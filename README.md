# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis Challenge
The purpose of this analysis challenge was to better our skills in DataFrames, by using functions such as groupby, pivot, and plots. Using these skilled helped us to clean the data to see the the average fare per driver and ride for the three city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). We then went on to break it down into a line chart that showed the avg. weekly fare for the three city types. 
## Results
### Deliverable 1
In Deliverable 1, we extracted the information we needed for the analysis by using the groupby, sum, and count functions as shown below. We then created a DataFrame to clearly see the data for Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities.

### Deliverable 2
In Deliverable 2, we grouped by type and date so we could see how much the fare was in the city type on a certain date. We then used the pivot function to get the city type's as columns and set the index to date. After that, we used the loc function to only show data from 1-1-2019 - 4-29-2019. To go even further, we resampled the data to break it down into average weekly fare by city type. Finally, we plotted the data as a line graph to see the data most clearly.
